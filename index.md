Welcome! I'm Somnath Pathak, proudly serving as an Advisory Software Engineer at IBM India Software Labs. My specialization in Cloud Engineering and Full Stack Development has enabled me to deliver dynamic cloud infrastructure solutions and intricate web applications.

Residing in the vibrant city of Bangalore, India, I seamlessly transition between roles - from cloud engineering to back-end & database development, and from crafting front-end experiences to designing user interfaces. When I step away from the keyboard, you might catch me riding the streets, fueled by my deep-seated passion for motorcycles.

If you're in pursuit of cloud engineering prowess, web development finesse, design insights, or expert consultation, I'm available for freelance engagements. Let's start a conversation and explore the potential of our collaboration!
